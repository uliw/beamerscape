convert inkscape layers to latex beamer slides
## Aout
This script takes an Inkscape .svg as input, and generates pdf files corresponding to each of the layers and a LaTeX file that uses the LaTeX Beamer commands to incrementally overlay them. It will export the layers into a directory with the same basename as the .svg file. The layers will be exported in pdf format to preserve transparency.
